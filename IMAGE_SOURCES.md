1.  **Format**: Prefer **WebP** for websites (Next.js optimizes this automatically).
2.  **Compression**: Run all images through [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) to reduce file size without losing quality.
3.  **Naming Convention**: Keep file names exactly as listed to match the code paths.
4.  **Alt Text**: Ensure every image contributes to the context.

## Temporary Placeholder Usage
If you need to view the site before the designer finishes, you can use **Unsplash Source** links in your data files:
